### Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
which provides only a base infrastructure, leaving the end user responsible for the platform and environment configurations necessary to deploy applications. 
Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure are prime examples of IaaS.

### Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
which provide a finished product for end users, such as Gmail or Salesforce.

### Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
which helps to reduce application development overhead (i.e. environment configuration) by providing a ready-to-use platform. 
PaaS services can be hosted on top of infrastructure provided by an IaaS.
