# Notations

## 3 Different Types
Big-O Notation (O-notation)

Omega Notation (Ω-notation)

Theta Notation (Θ-notation)

## Theta Notation (Θ-Notation)
Theta notation encloses the function from above and below. Since it represents the upper and the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm, it is used for analyzing the average-case complexity of an algorithm.

.Theta (Average Case) You add the running times for each possible input combination and take the average in the average case.

## Big-O Notation (O-notation)
Big-O notation represents the upper bound of the running time of an algorithm. Therefore, it gives the worst-case complexity of an algorithm.


.It is the most widely used notation for Asymptotic analysis.
.It specifies the upper bound of a function.
.The maximum time required by an algorithm or the worst-case time complexity.
.It returns the highest possible output value(big-O) for a given input.
.Big-O(Worst Case) It is defined as the condition that allows an algorithm to complete statement execution in the longest amount of time possible.
 
## Omega Notation (Ω-Notation):
Omega notation represents the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm. Thus, it provides the best case complexity of an algorithm.

The execution time serves as a lower bound on the algorithm’s time complexity.

It is defined as the condition that allows an algorithm to complete statement execution in the shortest amount of time.
